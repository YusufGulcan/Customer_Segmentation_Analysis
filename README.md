### Conclusion
Business Strategy According to the Findings
As a result of the analysis, there are 3 main customer segments; Diamond,Gold,Silver. General profile of a customer is as following:

**Diamond** - This segment is the most valuable among all. Losing these customers would severely hit the profitability of the business. The behaviours of these customers show that they are happy with the quality, price and other conditions. Therefore, customers from this segment should be provided with more than ordinary promotions to boost the relationship even more. An example could be giving early access for new productions, involving them into the decision-making processes of the business.

**Gold** - This segment is also happy with the business operations, however there are still some subtle improvements to make. Some may show relatively low frequency, some may have a low purchase volume. It is crucial to detect the improvable part and create solutions. For example; If the frequency is low, making analysis of substitute products on the market would be a good idea, because low frequency generally is an indicator of that the customer buys the products of other brands from time to time.

**Silver** - Silver customers are the hardest segment to regain.Renewed price lists, promotions, different accessibility options could be tried for strengthen the relationship. Example; if the problem is high recency, it is an amazing way to remind the products of the business by reaching out to the customers with new deals and promotions so that they get back to the old routine. Retention costs are high for this segment. They require more effort, more money and more time to be retained. It is not always profitable to spend resources for this segment. Only if the business aims to get more market share and profitability is not the priority, this segment should be targeted. Low cost activities should be chosen to detect what caused them to avoid the products.
